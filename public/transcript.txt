## A Day at 100x Dev: Insights from Web3 Experts

This blog post summarizes a 100x Dev meetup featuring prominent figures in the Web3 space.  The speakers shared their experiences, insights on hiring, and advice for aspiring developers.  The event was structured around individual speaker presentations, so this blog will follow that structure.


**Section 1: Karan – Co-Founder and CTO at Xerox People**

Karan's journey began in college, participating in a student-run software development group called the Information Management Group. This experience mimicked a corporate journey, teaching him coding, project management, and team leadership. He then embarked on an entrepreneurial path, founding a Y Combinator-backed AI startup. After this experience, he transitioned into Web3, joining Xerox People, a crypto-native social network.

Xerox People aims to integrate on-chain activity with social identity.  Users' on-chain transactions, asset holdings, and affiliations are publicly visible, providing a more comprehensive profile.  This is particularly relevant in the Web3 context, where on-chain activities are significant.  They are building this in a bear market, anticipating future growth in the crypto space.  Karan emphasized the team's high talent density and their unique hiring process, focusing on exceptional "High CPU" (high processing power/skill) and entrepreneurial traits.  They value engineers who can not only write clean code but also contribute to product decisions and strategic thinking.


**Section 2: Ano – Co-Founder and CTO at Apex**

Ano, from a Tier-3 college, proactively sought out startups. He shared two key experiences. First, he directly contacted the founder of a startup, expressing his interest and willingness to contribute.  This proactive approach led to an opportunity to build a video conferencing app, demonstrating his problem-solving skills. Second, during an interview at a Fintech company, he impressed the interviewers by replicating their app, including UPI payment integration, showcasing adaptability and exceeding expectations.

Ano’s hiring criteria at Apex highlight three key aspects: curiosity, learning capability, and communication.  He appreciates candidates who ask insightful questions, demonstrate fast learning abilities, and communicate effectively within a team.  He also advocates for "building in public," sharing projects on platforms like GitHub and Twitter to increase visibility and attract opportunities.


**Section 3: Shake – Web3 Developer and Solana Expert**

Shake's journey involved transitioning from Web2 to Web3. Initially bored with his job after an acquisition, he discovered Solana and Superteam, a Web3 community.  This community offered networking opportunities, mentorship, and exposure to hackathons, leading to significant financial gains.  He emphasizes the importance of finding the right online communities (like Superteam) for networking, learning, and career advancement in the fast-paced Web3 ecosystem. He highlights the current shortage of skilled Solana developers, creating a high demand for talent.


**Section 4: Oen – Web3 Job Hopper and Hackathon Winner**

Oen shared her experience of working across multiple Web3 roles over a short period.  Her advice focuses on identifying and navigating growing markets.  Her success in winning multiple hackathons and securing a high-paying job demonstrates the financial potential within Web3, highlighting the rewards for skilled and adaptable individuals.


**Section 5:  Q&A and General Advice from the Panelists**

The Q&A session provided additional insights into various aspects of software development, including the relevance of DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) versus practical development skills, the role of college degrees versus practical experience, and the importance of choosing a career path that aligns with personal interests.  A recurring theme was the importance of proactive engagement, continuous learning, and focusing on problem-solving skills rather than solely focusing on specific technologies or metrics like CGPA.  The panelists emphasized the opportunities and potential within the Web3 space, especially for those who are willing to actively seek out learning opportunities and build their skills.
